Clyde is a game in which two players will try to make their 
opponent hit either their own tail or the tail of the opponent. 
The first person to succeed will be the winner. 

The game was designed so that the snake will always be growing 
its tail, making the game a bit more difficult and using the 
space that is available more efficiently
